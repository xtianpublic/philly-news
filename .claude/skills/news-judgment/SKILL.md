### Source Credibility

- **Transparency**: Named authors, clear sourcing, disclosure of conflicts
- **Verification**: Multiple independent sources, primary documentation
- **Expertise**: Subject matter knowledge, access to relevant sources

### Content Analysis
- **Headline accuracy**: Does it match the article content?

- **Evidence quality**: Primary vs secondary sources, documentation
- **Context**: Is necessary background provided?
- **Balance**: Are multiple perspectives represented fairly?

### Red Flags

## Output Format

3. **Verification Status**: [What's confirmed, what needs verification]
4. **Potential Bias**: [Any detected slant or omissions]
5. **Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low with reasoning]

## Examples

**Timeliness**: "Two bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon earlier today."
**Impact**: "About 27,000 runners and 500,000 spectators from across the globe attended the Boston
Marathon."
**Prominence**: "President Obama at the White House reassured Americans that all questions about the bomb-
ings would be answered. 'We will get to the bottom of this. And we will find out who did this;
we'll find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel
the full weight of justice,' he said."
**Proximity**: "Two sisters from our city who ran in the Boston Marathon are coming home today.
Unusualness While thousands of spectators ran away from the explosions, many others ran toward the
chaos to help others."
**Conflict**: "President Obama called the bombings an act of terrorism."
**Hard news**: "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts in his first court appearance today."
**Soft news**: "The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual sporting event and is held on Patriot's Day,
the third Monday in April."

**Good indicator**: "According to court documents filed Tuesday, obtained by [News Org]..."
**Red flag**: "Sources say that officials are worried about..."

**Good indicator**: Article includes response from all parties involved
**Red flag**: One-sided account without seeking comment from subjects
